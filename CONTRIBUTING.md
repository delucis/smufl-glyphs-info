# Contributing to `smufl-glyphs-info`

`smufl-glyphs-info` consists of two parts:

1. [`lib/build.js`](lib/build.js) —
   a build script for processing the JSON metadata files from the SMuFL specification into files used by Glyphs

2. [`bin/cli.js`](bin/cli.js) —
   a command line interface that helps move the created files to the correct `Application Support` directory
